"""Log sink for the native runtime and for the thin Python layer.

The native runtime emits through ``tracing``; the binding forwards each
record here. The surrounding Python stack is loguru-based, so records go
to loguru and land in
whatever sinks an application already configured. Stdlib ``logging`` is a
fallback for installs without loguru, so the library still works if it is
absent.

Native-side filtering happens before this is called (see the ``DEXCONTROL_LOG``
/ ``RUST_LOG`` env vars), so this module is only reached by records that
already passed the level filter.

    dexcontrol is a library: importing it never touches logging
    configuration. Earlier 0.7 development builds restyled loguru's global
    logger as a side effect of the first native log record, from whichever
    thread emitted it; that is gone. Applications (and the bundled examples)
    that want that look call this once, from the main thread, before
    connecting::

        import dexcontrol
        dexcontrol.configure_logging()

    It adds one stderr sink to loguru with a compact format that colors
    WARNING yellow and ERROR/CRITICAL red (honouring ``NO_COLOR`` and
    non-TTY streams). With ``replace_default=True`` loguru's automatic
    stderr handler (id 0) is removed first so records are not printed twice;
    handlers the application added itself are never touched. Calling it
    again is a no-op. Native verbosity is filtered before records reach
    Python: set ``DEXCONTROL_LOG`` (or ``RUST_LOG``), for example
    ``DEXCONTROL_LOG=dexcontrol=debug``.

    Returns:
        True when the sink was installed by this call, False when loguru is

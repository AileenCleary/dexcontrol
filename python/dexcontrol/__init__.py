    By default Python dies immediately on SIGTERM and SIGHUP without running
    ``atexit`` hooks, so ``systemctl stop``, ``docker stop``, ``kill`` or a
    closed terminal ends the process WITHOUT the robot shutdown (and its
    stop request) that a normal exit performs. The pre-0.6 package installed
    such handlers implicitly at import; 0.7 installs none, because a library
    must not take over process-wide signal handling behind the
    application's back. Call this once, from the main thread, if nothing
    else in your application handles these signals::

        import dexcontrol
        dexcontrol.install_signal_handlers()

    The handler raises ``SystemExit(128 + signum)`` in the main thread, so
    ``finally`` blocks, context managers and ``atexit`` (including
    dexcontrol's robot shutdown) run. SIGINT is left alone: Python already
    turns it into ``KeyboardInterrupt``.

    Args:
        signals: Signal numbers to handle. Defaults to SIGTERM and, where it
            exists, SIGHUP.

    Raises:
        ValueError: when called from a thread other than the main thread
            (a ``signal.signal`` restriction).

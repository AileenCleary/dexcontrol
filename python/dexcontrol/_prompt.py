"""Interactive prompts that stay readable next to the native log stream.

A plain ``input()`` in a script that has a connected ``Robot`` is easy to
miss: the native runtime keeps logging from its own threads (connection
progress, the watchdog, safety notifications), and a record printed right
after the question lands on the same terminal line and buries it. These
helpers flush what the runtime has already logged, keep further records
back until the answer is in, and put the question on a line of its own.

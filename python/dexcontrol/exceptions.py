"""Custom exceptions for dexcontrol.

This module defines a hierarchy of exceptions for better error handling
and user experience when connection or configuration issues occur. Every
native (Rust) failure raised by dexcontrol is an instance of one of these
classes, so ``except dexcontrol.DexcontrolError`` catches them all; pure
argument validation raises the built-in ``ValueError``/``TypeError``.
"""

    All custom dexcontrol exceptions inherit from this class,
    making it easy to catch all dexcontrol-specific errors.

            error variant that produced this exception (for example
            ``"Timeout"``, ``"StaleState"``, ``"WriteBlocked"``). ``None``
            for exceptions raised by the pure-Python layer. Exceptions the
            binding raises as built-in ``ValueError`` carry the same

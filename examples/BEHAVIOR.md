# What each example does

This reference describes source behavior with default options on a compatible robot.
It is not evidence of physical execution or convergence. See `--help` for overrides.

## Connections, waiting, and output

- Except for the two DiagnosticClient scripts, a `Robot` connection can enable compatible arm modes during startup. Shutdown requests a stop even for an example whose main body only reads state.
- Shared control examples use real hardware unless `--simulated` is passed. Python-only planning/gamepad/heartbeat programs have no simulation flag. Required action/file arguments are validated before the main task runs.
- Managed joint motion does not imply collision avoidance. A caller wait timeout does not cancel the server operation; cleanup attempts to stop it. Group publication is best-effort, not synchronized execution.
- Many small motion examples use `wait()`, which can return a cancelled or superseded terminal status. Returning from that wait alone does not prove the target was reached; `wait_success()` requires successful completion.
- Sensor loops poll cached observations. A sample/iteration count does not promise that many unique fresh frames; unavailable frames may produce no output. Rust sampling loops generally also pause after the final read, while Python/C++ scalar loops usually pause only between reads.
- Python LiDAR, camera and current monitors open/connect a Rerun viewer unless `--no-display`; missing rerun-sdk falls back to printing. C++/Rust print summaries and do not open a viewer.
- Only tracking benchmarks write measurement files by default. Polling a sensor does not save its data. Interactive scripts continue until their documented quit/interrupt condition.

## Shared tasks

### `advanced_examples/steer_chassis_sine`

Drive forward while sinusoidally changing both steering angles.

For 6 s at 50 Hz, command both wheel speeds to 0.5 m/s and both steering angles to 0.6*sin(2*pi*0.5*t) rad. Request a stop on completion/cleanup. Requires a steer-drive base; it does not use generic chassis yaw velocity.

Connection: **control**.

### `advanced_examples/configure_arm_pid`

Read or set arm PID multipliers.

Require positional get or set. Address both arms by default; set sends seven multipliers, each defaulting to 1.0. Print service replies. PID writes can take about 40 s; the SDK waits up to 45 s for a reply. A timeout does not cancel a server-side write.

Connection: **control**.

### `advanced_examples/configure_ee_baud_rate`

Read or set end-effector RS485 baud rates.

Require positional get or set. Address both arm end-effector interfaces by default; set uses 115200 baud unless overridden. Print service replies.

Connection: **control**.

### `advanced_examples/configure_arm_ft_sensor`

Read, enable, or disable arm force-torque sensor modes.

Require positional get, enable, or disable. Address both arms by default and print service replies; this does not zero the force sensors.

Connection: **control**.

[Python](vega_1/python/advanced_examples/configure_arm_ft_sensor.py) · [C++](vega_1/cpp/advanced_examples/configure_arm_ft_sensor.cpp) · [Rust](vega_1/rust/src/advanced_examples/configure_arm_ft_sensor.rs) (`advanced-configure-arm-ft-sensor`)

### `advanced_examples/send_end_effector_bytes`

Send raw bytes to end effectors and poll for replies.

By default, send hex 09 10 03 E8 00 03 06 01 00 00 00 00 00 72 E1 to both configured arm pass-through interfaces and poll for up to 1 s each. The attached device determines what these bytes do; this is not a generic motion command.

### `advanced_examples/manage_arm_brakes`

Read, release, or engage arm brakes.

Require positional status, release, or engage. status and engage address both arms and all their joints unless --side or --joint narrow them. release has no defaults: it requires --side left, right, or both, and either --joint INDEX (repeatable) or --all. Before releasing, warn that the arm must be physically supported, because a released joint can drop under gravity, and require typing yes; --yes skips the prompt and simulated runs do not prompt. This operates the brake service, not the motor-mode service.

Connection: **control**.

### `advanced_examples/monitor_joint_currents`

Monitor joint currents for components that report per-joint current.

Probe all components by default, skip unsupported current readings, then poll continuously at 0.02 s intervals until Ctrl-C; --samples N stops after N polls. Fail if none report current; --component limits the selection.

### `advanced_examples/pose_both_arms`

Move both arms to a named pose using independent tracked motions.

Default to folded at velocity scale 0.5. Resolve each pose using its model-declared frame: folded poses are joint-relative; orientation reference poses use torso pitch. --passthrough uses raw stored values. Start both targets through best-effort fan-out, wait up to 10 s, and require aggregate success. No synchronized start or collision checking is provided.

Connection: **control**.

### `advanced_examples/fold_or_unfold_robot`

Fold or unfold the robot in ordered, verified stages.

Default: close available hands, move both arms to folded, then torso to folded and head to tucked. With --unfold: move torso to crouch45_high, then resolve/move head home, then resolve/move arms to L_shape. Skip absent components; check motion success and measured positions within 0.1 rad before advancing. No collision checking is provided.

Connection: **control**.

### `advanced_examples/keyboard_jog_joint`

Jog a selected joint using keyboard commands.

Default component is left_arm and selected joint is 0. w/s move in opposite directions, digits select a joint, and q exits. Interaction and command increments differ by language; see the language notes.

Connection: **control**.

[Python](vega_1/python/advanced_examples/keyboard_jog_joint.py) · [C++](vega_1/cpp/advanced_examples/keyboard_jog_joint.cpp) · [Rust](vega_1/rust/src/advanced_examples/keyboard_jog_joint.rs) (`advanced-keyboard-jog-joint`)

- **python**: Raw-terminal hold/repeat w/s input at 100 Hz and 0.2 rad/s. A tap moves the joint by up to 0.05 rad; a hold keeps moving and stops within 0.05 rad of the release. Runs until q/Ctrl-C; no duration option.
- **cpp**: Same hold/repeat and tap behaviour, with an optional duration limit; raw-terminal input on Linux.
- **rust**: Line input: press Enter after each command. Each w/s applies a 0.02 rad direct step by default; EOF or q exits. Does not implement key-hold velocity control.

### `advanced_examples/move_to_pose/pose_arm`

Move one arm to a named pose using its model-declared reference frame.

Move the right arm to L_shape with model-defined torso-pitch compensation; wait up to 10 s. folded and folded_closed_hand stay joint-relative and receive no compensation. zero stores seven zeros relative to an upright torso and compensates only torso tilt from upright; --passthrough returns literal zeros. --passthrough uses raw stored values while retaining target validation. No collision checking is performed.

### `advanced_examples/reboot_control_board`

Request a reboot of one robot control board.

Require positional arm, torso, or chassis. The arm board controls both arms. A rebooting board stops controlling its joints, so ask for confirmation first and require typing yes; --yes skips the prompt and simulated runs do not prompt. Send the request and exit; do not wait for the board to come back online.

Connection: **control**.

- **python**: CSV input (the format all three languages share; NPZ recordings are still accepted). Prompt, optionally smooth/resample/plot, then prompt before folding both arms, sending head home, crouching torso to crouch20_medium, re-resolving head home for the new torso posture, and closing hands. Press Enter before moving to the recorded first row and streaming. Defaults: 0.1 s position smoothing, speed factor 1, no velocity feed-forward; rate from file or 500 Hz. Checks every sample against the robot model's joint limits before moving and reports violations per joint; --clamp-to-model-limits clips them instead of refusing the file.
- **cpp**: CSV input. Performs the same extra folding/head/torso/hand preparation as Python. Supports smoothing, resampling and velocity feed-forward; --visualize prints a summary instead of a plot. Prompts before preparation and playback.
- **rust**: CSV input. Confirm unless --no-confirm (simulation bypasses the prompt); move directly to the recorded first row, then stream. Does not fold/crouch/close hands or smooth/resample/add velocity feed-forward. Rate from file or 500 Hz.

### `basic_examples/control/close_hand`

Close one hand using its model-defined pose.

### `basic_examples/control/cycle_arm`

Move one arm joint by an offset, then return to its starting position.

Save the right arm positions, move joint 0 by +0.2 rad, then return to the saved absolute start after outward success. By default compute an absolute outward target; --relative resolves the offset from fresh feedback. Both motions use velocity scale 0.2 and a 10 s wait deadline.

### `basic_examples/sensors/monitor_wrist_cameras`

Monitor frames from the configured wrist cameras.

Enable left_wrist_camera and right_wrist_camera unless --sensor supplies names. Subscribe to selected/all advertised streams, poll 200 times at 30 Hz, then unsubscribe. No particular camera brand is required and no image files are saved.

Connection: **control**.

[Python](vega_1/python/basic_examples/sensors/monitor_wrist_cameras.py) · [C++](vega_1/cpp/basic_examples/sensors/monitor_wrist_cameras.cpp) · [Rust](vega_1/rust/src/basic_examples/sensors/monitor_wrist_cameras.rs) (`sensor-monitor-wrist-cameras`)

- **python**: Starts/connects a Rerun viewer by default; --no-display prints instead. Missing rerun-sdk falls back to printing.
- **cpp**: Prints numeric summaries/frame metadata; does not open a viewer.
- **rust**: Prints numeric summaries/frame metadata; does not open a viewer.

### `benchmark/arm_tracking/benchmark_arm_sine`

Benchmark each arm joint with a sine trajectory and velocity feed-forward.

Prompt for confirmation unless --no-confirm; move the right seven-joint arm to [0,0,0,-0.5,0,0,0] rad. Test each joint for 10 s at 200 Hz with a 0.4 rad, 1 Hz sine; return to the reference between joints and at the end. Write measurement files. This reference is not an all-zero pose. The amplitude is fitted to each joint's limits: the position limits from the reference pose and the velocity limit against the feed-forward peak (amplitude times angular frequency), reduced with a warning where the requested amplitude does not fit. Stream with the step guard disabled (tracking lag is what is measured).

Connection: **control**.

- **python**: Writes per-joint CSV, data.npz and summary.png under results beside this script; requires matplotlib.
- **cpp**: Writes per-joint CSV and parameters.txt under the requested output directory.
- **rust**: Writes per-joint CSV and prints tracking errors; no plots/NPZ. --timeout controls managed-motion waits.

### `benchmark/arm_tracking/benchmark_arm_step`

Benchmark each arm joint with a ramped step trajectory.

Prompt unless --no-confirm; move the right seven-joint arm to [0,0,0,-0.5,0,0,0] rad. Test each joint for 5 s at 200 Hz: hold 0.3 s, ramp by pi/6 rad over 0.3 s, then hold. The step is fitted to each joint's limits from the reference pose: the other direction where the requested one does not fit, a smaller step where neither does, each logged. Stream positions without velocity feed-forward and with the step guard disabled (tracking lag is what is measured); return to the reference between joints and at the end. Write measurement files.

## Python-only programs and helpers

### [run_cartesian_admittance.py](vega_1/python/advanced_examples/run_cartesian_admittance.py)

Run wrench-based Cartesian admittance on both arms until interrupted.

Uses dexmotion inverse kinematics and both arm wrench streams. Default gain is 1.0, zero-force mode is enabled, and no blue-button gate is required unless --need-button is set. Streams direct joint targets until Ctrl-C, then requests shutdown. Uses a real Robot control connection with normal startup side effects; no simulation flag.

Connection: **control**.

### [plan_arm_pose.py](vega_1/python/advanced_examples/plan_arm_pose.py)

Plan and execute a both-arm named-pose move with dexmotion.

Connect to the real robot and build a geometry-aware OMPL plan to L_shape with torso-pitch compensation, sampled at 250 Hz. If initially self-colliding, propose a separate escape interpolation and require confirmation. Require confirmation before executing the final path; the dexmotion viewer is on by default (--no-visualize turns it off). Collision checking covers the configured model, not a guarantee about the physical workspace. No simulation flag.

Connection: **control**.

### [offset_end_effectors.py](vega_1/python/advanced_examples/offset_end_effectors.py)

Execute four planned relative end-effector moves with Enter prompts.

Using dexmotion at 250 Hz: move the right end effector +0.1 m in z in frame R_arm_j5; move the left +0.1 m in y; move the left +0.1 m in x in frame L_arm_j3; rotate the right +pi/4 around x. Prompt before each segment and stream both arm joint arrays. Uses a real Robot control connection; no simulation flag.

Connection: **control**.

### [_viewer.py](vega_1/python/basic_examples/sensors/_viewer.py)

Shared Rerun display helpers; not an executable example.

Imported by sensor/current scripts. start() opens/connects a viewer unless --no-display is set; missing rerun-sdk falls back to printing. Running this module directly starts no viewer or robot connection.

Connection: **helper**.

### [_tracking_helpers.py](vega_1/python/benchmark/arm_tracking/_tracking_helpers.py)

Shared seven-joint tracking reference, CSV, and validation helpers.

Imported by arm benchmarks; the reference vector is [0,0,0,-0.5,0,0,0] rad. Contains no standalone benchmark or robot connection.

Connection: **helper**.

### [stress_heartbeat_gil.py](vega_1/python/benchmark/connection/stress_heartbeat_gil.py)

Monitor heartbeat status while creating Python GIL contention.

For 30 s, start four CPU-bound worker threads by default and increase the Python thread switch interval to 0.1 s. Display a Rich heartbeat table; stop workers and restore the interval on normal cleanup. --no-gil-stress disables the load; --disable-heartbeat changes heartbeat policy. Uses a real Robot control connection, not read-only diagnostics; no motion benchmark and no simulation flag.

Connection: **control**.

### [gamepad_arm_cartesian_control.py](vega_1/python/teleop/gamepad_arm_cartesian_control.py)

Control arm end-effector translation and rotation with a DualSense gamepad.

Select the left arm initially; L1 gates interactive movement, R1 switches arms, and R2 toggles translation/rotation mode. Run dexmotion IK and stream arm targets at 400 Hz until interrupted. The arm IK helper pauses the SDK heartbeat monitor and resumes it on cleanup. Uses a real Robot control connection; no simulation flag.

Connection: **control**.

### [gamepad_arm_joint_control.py](vega_1/python/teleop/gamepad_arm_joint_control.py)

Open available hands, then control arm joints with a DualSense gamepad.

Open both available hands before the interactive loop, without requiring L1 for this startup action. Select the left arm initially; L1 gates subsequent joint jogging, R1 switches arms, and face buttons/L2 select joints. Runs until interrupted at 200 Hz by default. Uses dexmotion, pauses the SDK heartbeat monitor in the arm IK helper, resumes it on cleanup, and shuts down the real Robot. No simulation flag.

Connection: **control**.

### [_arm_teleop_base.py](vega_1/python/teleop/_arm_teleop_base.py)

Shared arm teleoperation and dexmotion IK helpers; not an executable example.

Import support for the two arm gamepad scripts. Object construction can connect a Robot and pauses its heartbeat monitor after IK setup; arm cleanup resumes it. Running this module directly defines classes but starts no control loop.

Connection: **helper**.

### [gamepad_chassis_head.py](vega_1/python/teleop/gamepad_chassis_head.py)

Move the head home, then control chassis and head with a DualSense gamepad.

At startup, send a torso-pitch-compensated head home target before L1 is pressed. Then use L1-gated chassis/head control at 400 Hz; default maximum linear/angular speeds are 0.5 m/s and 1 rad/s. Touchpad toggles E-stop; the head-mode control can enable/disable head motors. Runs until interrupted, then requests stop/shutdown. Real Robot connection; no simulation flag.

Connection: **control**.

### [_dualsense_teleop_base.py](vega_1/python/teleop/_dualsense_teleop_base.py)

Shared DualSense connection, button mapping, and cleanup helpers.

Imported by gamepad examples. Instantiation activates the controller and connects a Robot; L1 manages interactive movement state and touchpad toggles software E-stop. Running this module directly defines classes but starts no control loop.

Connection: **helper**.

## Offline conversion tools

## Native support files

`vega_1/rust/src/lib.rs` supplies CLI parsing, connection/cleanup, camera printing and CSV helpers. It is a standalone binary.
C++ headers under `vega_1/cpp/common/` and the arm-tracking directory supply parsing, JSON, CSV, terminal, camera and control helpers. Fixtures under `fixtures/` are test inputs, not programs.

Regenerate with `python tools/generate_example_reference.py`; verify with `--check`.

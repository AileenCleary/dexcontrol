Resolve each pose using its model-declared frame: folded poses are joint-relative; orientation reference poses use torso pitch. --passthrough uses raw stored values. Start both targets through best-effort fan-out, wait up to 10 s, and require aggregate success. No synchronized start or collision checking is provided.

"""Move both arms to a named pose using independent tracked motions.

Default to folded at velocity scale 0.5. Resolve each pose using its model-declared frame: folded poses are joint-relative; orientation reference poses use torso pitch. --passthrough uses raw stored values. Start both targets through best-effort fan-out, wait up to 10 s, and require aggregate success. No synchronized start or collision checking is provided.

Uses a Robot control connection: compatible arm modes may be enabled during startup, and shutdown requests a stop. Real hardware is selected unless --simulated is supplied."""

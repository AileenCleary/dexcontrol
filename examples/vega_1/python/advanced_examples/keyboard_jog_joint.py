"""Jog a selected joint using keyboard commands.

Default component is left_arm and selected joint is 0. w/s move in opposite directions, digits select a joint, and q exits. Interaction and command increments differ by language; see the language notes.

Raw-terminal hold/repeat w/s input at 100 Hz and 0.2 rad/s. A tap moves the joint by up to 0.05 rad; a hold keeps moving and stops within 0.05 rad of the release. Runs until q/Ctrl-C; no duration option.

Uses a Robot control connection: compatible arm modes may be enabled during startup, and shutdown requests a stop. Real hardware is selected unless --simulated is supplied."""

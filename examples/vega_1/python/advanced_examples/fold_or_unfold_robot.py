"""Fold or unfold the robot in ordered, verified stages.

Default: close available hands, move both arms to folded, then torso to folded and head to tucked. With --unfold: move torso to crouch45_high, then resolve/move head home, then resolve/move arms to L_shape. Skip absent components; verify arms are in position mode (re-initializing them if not) before commanding them; check motion success and measured positions within 0.1 rad before advancing. No collision checking is provided.

Wait 1 s after closing each available hand before the arm stage.

Uses a Robot control connection: compatible arm modes may be enabled during startup, and shutdown requests a stop. Real hardware is selected unless --simulated is supplied."""

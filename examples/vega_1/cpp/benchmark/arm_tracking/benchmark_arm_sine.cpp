// Benchmark each arm joint with a sine trajectory and velocity feed-forward.
//
// Prompt for confirmation unless --no-confirm; move the right seven-joint arm to [0,0,0,-0.5,0,0,0] rad. Test each joint for 10 s at 200 Hz with a 0.4 rad, 1 Hz sine; return to the reference between joints and at the end. Write measurement files. This reference is not an all-zero pose. The amplitude is fitted to each joint's limits: the position limits from the reference pose and the velocity limit against the feed-forward peak (amplitude times angular frequency), reduced with a warning where the requested amplitude does not fit. Stream with the step guard disabled (tracking lag is what is measured).
//
// Writes per-joint CSV and parameters.txt under the requested output directory.
//
// Uses a Robot control connection: compatible arm modes may be enabled during startup, and shutdown requests a stop. Real hardware is selected unless --simulated is supplied.

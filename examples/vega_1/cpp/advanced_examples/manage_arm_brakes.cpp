// Read, release, or engage arm brakes.

// Require positional status, release, or engage. status and engage address both arms and all their joints unless --side or --joint narrow them. release has no defaults: it requires --side left, right, or both, and either --joint INDEX (repeatable) or --all. Before releasing, warn that the arm must be physically supported, because a released joint can drop under gravity, and require typing yes; --yes skips the prompt and simulated runs do not prompt. This operates the brake service, not the motor-mode service.

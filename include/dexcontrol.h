/* ======================================================================
 * Threading and lifetime
 *
 *   - Every handle (robot, diagnostic, component, motion, motion group,
 *     context, frame, lidar snapshot, rate limiter) may be used from several
 *     threads at the same time. Calls are internally synchronized; a blocking
 *     call (a waited move, dex_robot_wait_safety_event_json) blocks only its
 *     own thread.
 *   - Releasing a handle must not race with any other call on that same
 *     handle: a *_release is the one operation that needs exclusive access.
 *     Give a second thread its own reference with dex_robot_retain().
 *   - Components, motions and motion groups keep their robot alive. The
 *     robot disconnects when the LAST of them (and the robot handle itself)
 *     is released; if nobody called dex_robot_close() by then, that last
 *     release first runs a bounded (2 s) best-effort stop and shutdown, so a
 *     handle lost to an early return or a C++ exception never leaves a
 *     server-tracked motion running with no client. Call dex_robot_close()
 *     to stop at a moment you choose and to see the error.
 *   - dex_runtime_configure(), dex_watchdog_configure() and
 *     dex_safety_configure() are PROCESS-GLOBAL: they affect every robot
 *     created afterwards, from any thread, and racing them against a
 *     dex_robot_create*() on another thread is a bug in the caller. Prefer
 *     the per-robot fields of dex_robot_options_t.
 *   - No function may be called from a signal handler.
 * ====================================================================== */

/* ======================================================================
 * The full facade.
 *
 * Conventions for everything below:
 *   - Text comes back as an owned, NUL-terminated string in `*out` and is
 *     released with dex_string_free(). Raw bytes come back as a
 *     dex_buffer_t released with dex_buffer_free().
 *   - Numeric arrays fill caller storage of `capacity` elements. The
 *     required element count is always written to `*out_count`, so a call
 *     with a null array or zero capacity is a size probe that fails with
 *     DEX_INVALID_ARGUMENT after reporting the count. Optional arrays
 *     (documented as "may be null") are simply skipped when null.
 *   - Extensible structs carry struct_size; call their _init first, or
 *     zero them and set struct_size = sizeof. For every INPUT struct the two
 *     are equivalent by construction: each field's zero is its safe default
 *     (limits enforced, guards on, configured freshness), and every opt-out
 *     is a non-zero value you have to write on purpose. Flags in input
 *     structs are uint8_t, any non-zero byte meaning "set". Output structs
 *     must have struct_size set before the call; only that prefix is
 *     written.
 *   - Reads that need a sample that has not arrived report
 *     DEX_STATE_UNAVAILABLE. dex_robot_wait_for_state() waits for one.
